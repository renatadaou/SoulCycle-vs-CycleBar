# Taylor Swift Helps Me Burn More Calories. Here's Proof.
 In this project, I decided to compare CycleBar and SoulCycle, the two spin classes that I have taken while living in New York. 

My goal was to find which of the two spin studios were more effective in terms of exercizing and a better fit for the users.
I found, by comparing the stats that I imported from my personal Apple Watch, that my performance was overall better at CycleBar.

At CycleBar the mean of my calories burned was 398 and the median was 404.5
At SoulCycle the mean of my calories burned was 376 and the median was 355.5

One class in particular, at SoulCycle, went way above the average. The reason? I got very excited because it was a Taylor Swift ride before SuperBowl.

With the information from my Apple Watch, I calculated the mean and the medium, and graphed my performance. For the future, I would like to explore bettter if this is just me, who loves Taylor Swift, or if in general people perform better when they listen to songs they like.
