        <p>Spin classes are group fitness classes on indoor bikes, led by instructors, and are music-based. The classes include a warm-up, and intervals of high-intensity cycling with rest periods. The class is highly cardiovascular training. After moving to New York, I sought out studios that offered a similar format.
        </p>

        <p>After one class, I was sold. And if you have ever spent any time near me, you would know that I‚Äôm just like this:

        <p>Now, after 60+ classes in less than 6 months, I feel confident enough to offer a review of the studios and the class styles.

        <p>Lizzie quotes on performance</p>
        <p>While I generally perform better at CycleBar, that was one class that completely made me go off the charts at SoulCycle.</p>

       <iframe title="The Taylor Swift Themed Class Made Me Go Off the Chart" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-BhvnA" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BhvnA/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

        <p>Something with my heartbeat???</p>

        </script>

        <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Instructors and vibes ü™©üéº</strong></h2>

        <p>I took the Taylor Swift class on Super Bowl Sunday. In this class, I burned more calories than any other class I‚Äôve taken. The instructor, Anthony Winters, had the best vibes. He was constantly pushing us to do better, but what made me tune in to the class was the choreography which just made it super fun, and the constant encouragement to sing along to the lyrics. Next thing you know, I was singing (screaming) to ‚ÄúI Did Something Bad.‚Äù I can‚Äôt wait for Reputation (Taylor‚Äôs Version), by the way.</p>

        <p>I always feel more energetic if I like the instructor and their playlist.</p>

        <p>Alex Frost quote on different instructor and styles</p>
        <p>Julia quote on rides and how classes feel longer/shorter depending on music</p>
        <p>Lizzie quotes on song selection and feedback from riders</p>

        <P>If you like hyper energetic instructors like me, I recommend Kaylin Gonzalez and Lizzie Trull at CycleBar, and Anthony Winters and Alex Frost at SoulCycle. 
        </P>

        <h2 class="subhead"><strong>First timers ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåà</strong></h2>

        <p>Entering a spin class where everyone appears to have enough energy to power a small village can feel intimidating. However, if it's your first time, it's important not to let fear get the best of you.
        </p>

        <p>‚ÄúI expected to feel a little more lost when getting there,‚Äù Gladys Gerbaud, a master's student at Columbia Journalism School said about her first class at SoulCycle.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to get on a bike but the people were very helpful so they signed me in and someone <strong> me get on my bike properly. </strong>‚Äù</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, Alex Frost, a SoulCycle instructor, emphasizes the importance of modifications for all riders, whether beginners or seasoned cyclists. </p>

        <p>‚ÄúThere are days that even my body doesn‚Äôt feel like I can go 100% fast, so I modify and I try to make it a group thing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I don‚Äôt make people feel like they are alone when they are riding for the first time.‚Äù</p>
    
        <P>Julia Macri, a software engineer who attends CycleBar classes, echoed this sentiment, reflecting on her initial expectations and how they were pleasantly surpassed. 
        </P>

        <p> ‚ÄúMy expectations of the class going in were that I would dislike it and get bored very quickly,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI thought that I couldn't stand up on the bike for a very long time and I would want to leave the class halfway through. After the first class, I realized I actually enjoyed it and <strong>you can modify it to how you like, so you can make the 45 minutes your own</strong>. If you can't stand up in the saddle you can just sit in the seat. Much better than I expected and I was entertained for 45 minutes most of the time.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Lizzie Trull, the lead instructor at CycleBar Flatiron, emphasizes that, just like the people attending the class, she is also doing the workout while teaching, and she shares the class struggles.
        </p>

        <p>‚ÄúI hope that people know that I am so normal and I am going through the same stuff,‚Äù Trull said. ‚Äú<strong> power pushes are kicking my ass </strong> and I am doing the work as well. I am up there really going through it with you guys.‚Äù
        </p>

        <P>Just remember! Everyone was a beginner once. You are not alone in the ride.</P>

        <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Prices üíµüí∞</strong></h2>

        <p>At CycleBar, borrowing cycling shoes is complimentary, while at SoulCycle, each shoe rental is an <strong>additional $4 charge</strong>. SoulCycle offers a wider range of package and membership options, including a 30-class pack, 12 monthly classes, and other selections. They also provide a student discount. For CycleBar, you need to pay attention to your email! They frequently offer discounts to members via email. Personally, I always wait for these discounts before purchasing, and I've taken advantage of their offer of a <strong> 20-class pack for $350 twice now</strong>.
        </p>

        <iframe title="How Much Do You Need to Invest To Ride?" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-aGv0E" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aGv0E/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="401" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p>I recommend following the CycleBar instructors on Instagram. They even encourage this by putting the QR code on their profiles in the studio. This not only helps you track your favorite instructors' schedules and themes for the week but also offers the chance to win <strong> free guest bikes </strong> or attend complimentary private classes. Moreover, if it's your first time, reaching out to the instructor via direct message may earn you a free guest bike.
        </p>

        <p>Although not as regular as CycleBar, SoulCycle also periodically offers discounts. For my initial visit, I took advantage of a special promotion of <strong> 2 weeks of classes for just $50 </strong>, and I took classes every day. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Location üèôÔ∏èüìå</strong></h2>

        <iframe title="SoulCycle x CycleBar: New York City Locations" aria-label="Locator maps" id="datawrapper-chart-5QVLr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5QVLr/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="616" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p>As someone who lives in the Upper West Side, I feel like there are no great options. While the closest studio, SoulCycle at 77th Street, isn't too far, it's still not the best location. With my options, I prefer studios in Chelsea. They tend to be less crowded, surrounded by multiple dining options (and Trader Joe‚Äôs!), and easily accessible via the 1 train.</p>
        
        <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Have fun! ‚ú®ü©∑</strong></h2>

        <p>‚ÄúLeave expectations at the door,‚Äù Frost said. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs easier said than done. But just know that everybody is rooting for you and it‚Äôs all about cultivating good energy.‚Äù
