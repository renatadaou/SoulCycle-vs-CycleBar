            <p class="subhead">Spin classes are a great way to improve cardiovascular training, exercise, and have fun. With Taylor Swift, the fun increases.</p>

            <h2 class="subhead"><strong>What are spin classes? üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</strong></h2>
    
            <p>Spin classes are group fitness classes on indoor bikes, led by instructors, and are music-based. The classes include a warm-up, and intervals of high-intensity cycling with rest periods. The class is highly cardiovascular training. After moving to New York, I sought out studios that offered a similar format.
            </p>
    
            <p>After one class, I was sold. And if you have ever spent any time near me, you would know that I‚Äôm just like this:

                <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
    
            <p>Now, after more than 60 classes in less than 6 months, I feel confident enough to offer a review of the studios and the class styles. 
    
            </p>
    
            <h2 class="subhead"><strong>My stats üéØüìà</strong></h2>
    
            <p> <strong>My performances are better at CycleBar, in terms of both heart rate and burning calories.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>At CycleBar, my average calorie burn was 398 calories, with the mid-point falling at 404.5 calories, showcasing a consistent performance across classes. At SoulCycle I had an average burn of 376 calories, with the middle point settling at 355.5 calories, lower than CycleBar.
            </p>
    
            <p>For me, this happens because at CycleBar, <strong>I can see the statistics of how I am performing while I ride.</strong> During my rides there, a monitor displays statistics such as my power output, cycling speed, and the resistance level set on my bike. The instructors also sporadically put up a board with these statistics. This real-time feedback not only allows me to track my individual progress but also offers insights into how I‚Äôm doing in comparison to other riders.
            </p>
    
            <P>‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching the stats through the whole class, and when I feel like we are having a powerful moment, I throw it [the class statistics] up,‚Äù Lizzie Trull said, the lead instructor at CycleBar. ‚ÄúI feel like it‚Äôs inspiring to riders to see how they are doing [alone] and how they are doing as a team because, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs a team effort. I think it‚Äôs important to lean into the team stats and averages and use these to push people to work a little harder.‚Äù</P>
    
            <P>While I generally perform better at CycleBar, there was one class that significantly increased my performance at SoulCycle. This particular class being out of the rdinary can be explained.
            </P>
    
            <p>‚ÄúWhen people know and like the song, a lot of this [exercise] is music-driven,‚Äù Trull said. ‚ÄúWhen people enjoy and can feel the song, I can tell that people are working a little bit harder.‚Äù 
            </p>
    
           <iframe title="The Taylor Swift Themed Class Made Me Go Off the Chart" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-BhvnA" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BhvnA/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
    </script>
    
            <p>My heart rate has also been different at CycleBar and SoulCycle. At CycleBar, my average heart rate stood at 158 beats per minute (bpm), with the mid-point landing at 163 bpm. In contrast, during my sessions at SoulCycle, my average heart rate measured 149 bpm, and the mid-point settled at 155 bpm, a lower rate compared to CycleBar.
            </p>
    
            <p>At the Taylor Swift class, I surpassed these statistics. 
            </p>

            </script>
    
            <P>I promise I did not go into cardiac arrest. </P>
    
            <p>To understand when to turn up or down the intensity of the class, Trull said she looks for feedback from the riders as the class moves. 
            </p>
    
            <P>‚ÄúIf I look out into the room and I see there are a lot of people who look totally winded maybe I‚Äôll opt to do a little more movement versus a heavy interval,‚Äù she said.
            </P>
    
            <p>Reflecting on the class experience, Julia Macri, a software engineer and CycleBar attendee, shared her thoughts on the ranking system. </p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúI guess the ranking system sometimes I don't love,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut it's nice to see yourself improve. That's always fun. Sometimes discouraging if you are at very bottom, but that's ok.‚Äù
            </p>
    
            <p>Marci also emphasized the significance of music and instructor support in enhancing her performance. 
            </p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúIf the music is good, then I'm really having fun,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIf the music is something I don't vibe with then sometimes it can feel long, but I really appreciate the instructors, encouraging me throughout the class.‚Äù
            </p>
    
            <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Instructors and vibes ü™©üéº</strong></h2>
    
            <p>When I attended the Taylor Swift class on Super Bowl Sunday, the instructor, Anthony Winters, had the best vibes. What made me tune in to the class was the choreography and the constant encouragement to sing along to the lyrics. Next thing you know, I was singing (screaming) to ‚ÄúI Did Something Bad.‚Äù I can‚Äôt wait for Reputation (Taylor‚Äôs Version), by the way.
            </p>
    
            <p>I've noticed that my energy level during class is greatly influenced by the instructor and their playlist. The class atmosphere also varies depending on the instructor's style. Some prefer power and strength-based sessions, focusing on increasing resistance and incorporating intense upper-body workouts with weights. Others lean towards a more dance and rhythm-based approach.</p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúI find my true joy and I find that I teach the best class with a little more rhythm and leaning into the musicality of the class more,‚Äù said Alex Frost, a SoulCycle instructor. ‚ÄúIt is also easier to add the choreography when I have the rhythm supporting me.‚Äù
            </p>
    
            <p>Frost emphasized the importance of taking the time to find instructors who resonate with you and selecting music that suits your preferences, as these factors influence the overall class experience.</p>
           
            <p>‚ÄúI loved the music for the first class that I went, which was with Alex, and I ended up going to another one of her classes and I loved the music there as well,‚Äù Gladys Gerbaud, a master's student at the Columbia Journalism School said. ‚ÄúI went to another class with another instructor, and I didn‚Äôt love the music but I think that is just personal taste.‚Äù
            </p>
    
            <p>On the other hand, instructors like Trull focus more on strength training, challenging riders with heavier pushes. Trull admitted that the strength training aspect of spin classes became her favorite. She even teaches a strength class at CycleBar that features three rounds of upper body work.
            </p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúWhat I love, and I am a prior athlete, is the strength part of it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo it was hard for me in the beginning to get into the more fun, like dancey stuff. But when I love the music, it‚Äôs so easy for me to cue a little bit of choreography.‚Äù</p>
            
            <p>Macri noted that the class atmosphere is much more engaging than cycling alone in a gym for 30 minutes.</p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúYou can really push yourself ps bar more than I would in the gym and exceed what you thought was possible,‚Äù she said.
            </p>
            
            <P>If you like hyper energetic instructors like me, I recommend <strong>Kaylin Gonzalez and Lizzie Trull at CycleBar, and Anthony Winters and Alex Frost at SoulCycle</strong>. 
            </P>
    
            <h2 class="subhead"><strong>First timers ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåà</strong></h2>
    
            <p>Entering a spin class where everyone appears to have enough energy to power a small village can feel intimidating. However, if it's your first time, it's important not to let fear get the best of you.
            </p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúI expected to feel a little more lost when getting there,‚Äù Gerbaud said about her first class at SoulCycle.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to get on a bike but the people were very helpful so they signed me in and someone <strong> me get on my bike properly. </strong>‚Äù</p>
            
            <p>Similarly, Frost emphasizes the importance of modifications for all riders, whether beginners or seasoned cyclists. </p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúThere are days that even my body doesn‚Äôt feel like I can go 100% fast, so I modify and I try to make it a group thing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I don‚Äôt make people feel like they are alone when they are riding for the first time.‚Äù</p>
        
            <P>Macri echoed this sentiment, reflecting on her initial expectations and how they were pleasantly surpassed. 
            </P>
    
            <p> ‚ÄúMy expectations of the class going in were that I would dislike it and get bored very quickly,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI thought that I couldn't stand up on the bike for a very long time and I would want to leave the class halfway through. After the first class, I realized I actually enjoyed it and <strong>you can modify it to how you like, so you can make the 45 minutes your own</strong>. If you can't stand up in the saddle you can just sit in the seat. Much better than I expected and I was entertained for 45 minutes most of the time.‚Äù</p>
    
            <p>Trull emphasizes that, just like the people attending the class, she is also doing the workout while teaching, and she shares the class struggles.
            </p>
    
            <p>‚ÄúI hope that people know that I am so normal and I am going through the same stuff,‚Äù Trull said. ‚Äú<strong> power pushes are kicking my ass </strong> and I am doing the work as well. I am up there really going through it with you guys.‚Äù
            </p>
    
            <P>Just remember! Everyone was a beginner once. You are not alone in the ride.</P>
    
            <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Prices üíµüí∞</strong></h2>
    
            <p>At CycleBar, borrowing cycling shoes is complimentary, while at SoulCycle, each shoe rental is an <strong>additional four-dollar charge</strong>. SoulCycle offers a wider range of package and membership options, including a 30-class pack, twelve-monthly classes, and other selections. They also provide a student discount. For CycleBar, you need to pay attention to your email! They frequently offer discounts to members via email. Personally, I always wait for these discounts before purchasing, and I've taken advantage of their offer of a <strong> 20-class pack for 350 dollars twice now</strong>.
            </p>
    
            <iframe title="How Much Do You Need to Invest To Ride?" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-aGv0E" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aGv0E/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="401" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
    
            <p>I recommend following the CycleBar instructors on Instagram. They even encourage this by putting the QR code on their profiles in the studio. This not only helps you track your favorite instructors' schedules and themes for the week but also offers the chance to win <strong> free guest bikes </strong> or attend complimentary private classes. Moreover, if it's your first time, reaching out to the instructor via direct message may earn you a free guest bike.
            </p>
    
            <p>Although not as regular as CycleBar, SoulCycle also periodically offers discounts. For my initial visit, I took advantage of a special promotion of <strong> two weeks of classes for just $50 </strong>, and I took classes every day. 
            </p>
    
            <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Location üèôÔ∏èüìå</strong></h2>
    
            <iframe title="SoulCycle x CycleBar: New York City Locations" aria-label="Locator maps" id="datawrapper-chart-5QVLr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5QVLr/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="616" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
    
            <p>As someone who lives in the Upper West Side, I feel like there are no great options. While the closest studio, SoulCycle at 77th Street, isn't too far, it's still not the best location. With my options, I prefer studios in Chelsea. They tend to be less crowded, surrounded by multiple dining options (and Trader Joe‚Äôs!), and easily accessible via the 1 train.</p>
            
            <h2 class="subhead"><strong>Have fun! ‚ú®ü©∑</strong></h2>
    
            <p>‚ÄúLeave expectations at the door,‚Äù Frost said. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs easier said than done. But just know that everybody is rooting for you and it‚Äôs all about cultivating good energy.‚Äù
